Hey everybody. I am Billy, aka shinymodman and I have an interest in all select coding and I.T. I mainly work on applications, content and plugins 
that are specifically designed to work with Videogames and Apps that I am interested in.

As you should know, I mainly write content that are coded in high-level and dynamically linked programming languages. Languages that are mainly VB.NET, Ruby, Java and Lua.

I am also planning to learn how to code in C#, Python, AngelScript, and more of Lua.

This profile will mainly have repositories that contain apps and libraries that are addons to Apps, Websites and Videogames.

I am also on Discord if you have a question on anything with my built content.
